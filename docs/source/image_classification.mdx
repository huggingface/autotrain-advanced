# Image Classification

Image classification is a supervised learning problem: define a set of target classes (objects to identify in images), and train a model to recognize them using labeled example photos.
Using AutoTrain, its super-easy to train a state-of-the-art image classification model. Just upload a set of images, and AutoTrain will automatically train a model to classify them.

## Data Preparation

The data for image classification must be in zip format, with each class in a separate subfolder. For example, if you want to classify cats and dogs, your zip file should look like this:

```
cats_and_dogs.zip
├── cats
│   ├── cat.1.jpg
│   ├── cat.2.jpg
│   ├── cat.3.jpg
│   └── ...
└── dogs
    ├── dog.1.jpg
    ├── dog.2.jpg
    ├── dog.3.jpg
    └── ...
```

Some points to keep in mind:

- The zip file should contain multiple folders (the classes), each folder should contain images of a single class.
- The name of the folder should be the name of the class.
- The images must be jpeg, jpg or png.
- There should be at least 5 images per class.
- There should not be any other files in the zip file.
- There should not be any other folders inside the zip folder.

When train.zip is decompressed, it creates two folders: cats and dogs. these are the two categories for classification. The images for both categories are in their respective folders. You can have as many categories as you want.

## Training

Once you have your data ready and jobs added, you can start training your model by clicking the "Start Training" button.
