# Frequently Asked Questions

## Are my data and models secure?

Yes, your data and models are secure. AutoTrain uses the Hugging Face Hub to store your data and models.
All your data and models are uploaded to your Hugging Face account as private repositories and are only accessible by you.
Read more about security [here](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/security). 

## Do you upload my data to the Hugging Face Hub?

AutoTrain will not upload your dataset to the Hub if you are using the local backend or training in the same space.
AutoTrain will push your dataset to the Hub if you are using features like: DGX Cloud 
or using local CLI to train on Hugging Face's infrastructure.

You can safely remove the dataset from the Hub after training is complete.
If uploaded, the dataset will be stored in your Hugging Face account as a private repository and will only be accessible by you
and the training process. It is not used once the training is complete.

## I get error `Your installed package nvidia-ml-py is corrupted. Skip patch functions`

This error can be safely ignored. It is a warning from the `nvitop` library and does not affect the functionality of AutoTrain.

## I get 409 conflict error when using the UI

This error occurs when you try to create a project with the same name as an existing project. 
To resolve this error, you can either delete the existing project or create a new project 
with a different name.

This error can also occur when you are trying to train a model while a model is already training in the same space or locally.


## The model I want to use doesn't show up in the model selection dropdown.

If the model you want to use is not available in the model selection dropdown, 
you can add it in the environment variable `AUTOTRAIN_CUSTOM_MODELS` in the space settings.
For example, if you want to add the `xxx/yyy` model, go to space settings, create a variable named `AUTOTRAIN_CUSTOM_MODELS` 
and set the value to `xxx/yyy`.

You can also pass the model name as query parameter in the URL. For example, if you want to use the `xxx/yyy` model, 
you can use the URL `https://huggingface.co/spaces/your_autotrain_space?custom_models=xxx/yyy`.

## How do I use AutoTrain locally?

AutoTrain can be used locally by installing the AutoTrain Advanced pypi package.
You can read more in *Use AutoTrain Locally* section.


## Can I run AutoTrain on Colab?

To start the UI on Colab, you can simply click on the following link:

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/huggingface/autotrain-advanced/blob/main/colabs/AutoTrain.ipynb)

Please note, to run the app on Colab, you will need an ngrok token. You can get one by signing up for free on [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/).
This is because Colab does not allow exposing ports to the internet directly.

To use the CLI instead on Colab, you can follow the same instructions as for using AutoTrain locally.


## Does AutoTrain have a docker image?

Yes, AutoTrain has a docker image. 
You can find the docker image on Docker Hub [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/huggingface/autotrain-advanced).


## Is windows supported?

Unfortunately, AutoTrain does not officially support Windows at the moment.
You can try using WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) to run AutoTrain on Windows or the docker image.

## "--project-name" argument can not be set as a directory

`--project-name` argument should not be a path. it will be created where autotrain command is run.
This parameter must be alphanumeric and can contain hypens.

## I am getting `config.json` not found error

This means you have trained an adapter model (peft=true) which doesnt generate config.json. 
It doesnt matter though, the model can still be loaded with AutoModelForCausalLM or with Inference endpoints.
If you want to merge weights with base models, you can use `autotrain tools`. Please read about it in miscelleneous section.

## Does autotrain support multi-gpu training?

Yes, autotrain supports multi-gpu training. 
AutoTrain will determine on its own if the user is running the command on a multi-gpu setup and will use 
multi-gpu ddp if number of gpus is greater than 1 and less than 4 and deepspeed if number of gpus is greater than or equal to 4.


## How can i use a hub dataset with multiple configs?

If your hub dataset has multiple configs, you can use `train_split` parameter to specify the both the config and the split.
For example, in this dataset [here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/timdettmers/openassistant-guanaco),
there are multiple configs: `pair`, `pair-class`, `pair-score` and `triplet`.

If i want to use `train` split of `pair-class` config, i can use write `pair-class:train` as `train_split` in the UI or the CLI / config.

An example config is shown below:

```yaml
data:
  path: sentence-transformers/all-nli
  train_split: pair-class:train
  valid_split: pair-class:test
  column_mapping:
    sentence1_column: premise
    sentence2_column: hypothesis
    target_column: label

```
