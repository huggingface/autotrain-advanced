# Getting started

## Installation

There is no installation required! AutoTrain Advanced runs on Hugging Face Spaces. All you need to do is create a new space with the AutoTrain Advanced template: https://huggingface.co/new-space?template=autotrain-projects/autotrain-advanced. Please make sure you keep the space private.

Once you have selected Docker > AutoTrain template. You can click on "Create Space" and you will be redirected to your new space.

Once the space is build, you will see this screen:

You can now enter your Hugging Face Token to use the App. You can find your token at https://huggingface.co/settings/token.

Note: you can also add HF_TOKEN as an environment variable in your space settings to avoid having to enter it every time you start a new session. To do so, click on the "Settings" button in the top right corner of your space, then click on "New Secret" in the "Repository Secrets" section and add a new variable with the name HF_TOKEN and your token as the value as shown below:

## Updating AutoTrain Advanced to Latest Version

We are constantly adding new features and tasks to AutoTrain Advanced. Its always a good idea to update your space to the latest version before starting a new project. An up-to-date version of AutoTrain Advanced will have the latest tasks, features and bug fixes! Updating is as easy as clicking on the "Factory reboot" button in the setting page of your space.

Please note that "restarting" a space will not update it to the latest version. You need to "Factory reboot" the space to update it to the latest version.

And now we are all set and we can start with our first project!
