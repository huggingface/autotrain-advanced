# LLM Finetuning

With AutoTrain, you can easily finetune large language models (LLMs) on your own data. 
You can use AutoTrain to finetune LLMs for a variety of tasks, such as text generation, text classification, 
and text summarization. You can also use AutoTrain to finetune LLMs for specific use cases, such as chatbots, 
question-answering systems, and code generation and even basic fine-tuning tasks like classic text generation.


## Data Preparation

LLM finetuning accepts data in CSV and JSONL formats. JSONL is the preferred format.
How data is formatted depends on the task you are training the LLM for.

### Classic Text Generation

For text generation, the data should be in the following format:

| text                                                          |
|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| wikipedia is a free online encyclopedia                       |
| it is a collaborative project                                 |
| that anyone can edit                                          |
| wikipedia is the largest and most popular general reference work on the internet |

An example dataset for this format can be found here: [stas/openwebtext-10k](https://huggingface.co/datasets/stas/openwebtext-10k)

Example tasks:
- Text generation
- Code completion

Compatible trainers:
- SFT Trainer
- Generic Trainer

### Chatbot / question-answering / code generation / function calling

For this task, you can use CSV or JSONL data. If you are formatting the data yourself (adding start, end tokens, etc.), you can use CSV or JSONL format.
If you do not want to format the data yourself and want `--chat-template` parameter to format the data for you, you must use JSONL format.
In both cases, CSV and JSONL can be used interchangeably but JSONL is the most preferred format.

To train a chatbot, your data will have `content` and `role`. Some models support `system` role as well.

Here is an example of a chatbot dataset (single sample):

```
[{'content': 'Help write a letter of 100 -200 words to my future self for '
             'Kyra, reflecting on her goals and aspirations.',
  'role': 'user'},
 {'content': 'Dear Future Self,\n'
             '\n'
             "I hope you're happy and proud of what you've achieved. As I "
             "write this, I'm excited to think about our goals and how far "
             "you've come. One goal was to be a machine learning engineer. I "
             "hope you've worked hard and become skilled in this field. Keep "
             'learning and innovating. Traveling was important to us. I hope '
             "you've seen different places and enjoyed the beauty of our "
             'world. Remember the memories and lessons. Starting a family '
             'mattered to us. If you have kids, treasure every moment. Be '
             'patient, loving, and grateful for your family.\n'
             '\n'
             'Take care of yourself. Rest, reflect, and cherish the time you '
             'spend with loved ones. Remember your dreams and celebrate what '
             "you've achieved. Your determination brought you here. I'm "
             "excited to see the person you've become, the impact you've made, "
             'and the love and joy in your life. Embrace opportunities and '
             'keep dreaming big.\n'
             '\n'
             'With love,\n'
             'Kyra',
  'role': 'assistant'}]
```

As you can see, the data has `content` and `role` columns. The `role` column can be `user` or `assistant` or `system`.
This data is, however, not formatted for training. You can use the `--chat-template` parameter to format the data during training.

`--chat-template` supports the following kinds of templates:
- `none` (default)
- `zephyr`
- `chatml`
- `tokenizer`: use chat template mentioned in tokenizer config

A multi-line sample is also shown below:

```json
[{"content": "hello", "role": "user"}, {"content": "hi nice to meet you", "role": "assistant"}]
[{"content": "how are you", "role": "user"}, {"content": "I am fine", "role": "assistant"}]
[{"content": "What is your name?", "role": "user"}, {"content": "My name is Mary", "role": "assistant"}]
[{"content": "Which is the best programming language?", "role": "user"}, {"content": "Python", "role": "assistant"}]
.
.
.
```

An example dataset for this format can be found here: [HuggingFaceH4/no_robots](https://huggingface.co/datasets/HuggingFaceH4/no_robots)

If you dont want to format the data using `--chat-template`, you can format the data yourself and use the following format:

```
<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 03 Oct 2024\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nHelp write a letter of 100 -200 words to my future self for Kyra, reflecting on her goals and aspirations.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nDear Future Self,\n\nI hope you're happy and proud of what you've achieved. As I write this, I'm excited to think about our goals and how far you've come. One goal was to be a machine learning engineer. I hope you've worked hard and become skilled in this field. Keep learning and innovating. Traveling was important to us. I hope you've seen different places and enjoyed the beauty of our world. Remember the memories and lessons. Starting a family mattered to us. If you have kids, treasure every moment. Be patient, loving, and grateful for your family.\n\nTake care of yourself. Rest, reflect, and cherish the time you spend with loved ones. Remember your dreams and celebrate what you've achieved. Your determination brought you here. I'm excited to see the person you've become, the impact you've made, and the love and joy in your life. Embrace opportunities and keep dreaming big.\n\nWith love,\nKyra<|eot_id|>
```

A sample multi-line dataset is shown below:

```json
[{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 03 Oct 2024\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nhello<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nhi nice to meet you<|eot_id|>"}]
[{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 03 Oct 2024\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nhow are you<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nI am fine<|eot_id|>"}]
[{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 03 Oct 2024\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nWhat is your name?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nMy name is Mary<|eot_id|>"}]
[{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 03 Oct 2024\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nWhich is the best programming language?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nPython<|eot_id|>"}]
.
.
.
```

An example dataset for this format can be found here: [timdettmers/openassistant-guanaco](https://huggingface.co/datasets/timdettmers/openassistant-guanaco)

In the examples above, we have seen only two turns: one from the user and one from the assistant. However, you can have multiple turns from the user and assistant in a single sample.

Chat models can be trained using the following trainers:

- SFT Trainer:
    - requires only `text` column
    - example dataset: [HuggingFaceH4/no_robots](https://huggingface.co/datasets/HuggingFaceH4/no_robots)

- Generic Trainer:
    - requires only `text` column
    - example dataset: [HuggingFaceH4/no_robots](https://huggingface.co/datasets/HuggingFaceH4/no_robots)

- Reward Trainer:
    - requires `text` and `rejected_text` columns
    - example dataset: [trl-lib/ultrafeedback_binarized](https://huggingface.co/datasets/trl-lib/ultrafeedback_binarized)

- DPO Trainer:
    - requires `prompt`, `text`, and `rejected_text` columns
    - example dataset: [trl-lib/ultrafeedback_binarized](https://huggingface.co/datasets/trl-lib/ultrafeedback_binarized)

- ORPO Trainer:
    - requires `prompt`, `text`, and `rejected_text` columns
    - example dataset: [trl-lib/ultrafeedback_binarized](https://huggingface.co/datasets/trl-lib/ultrafeedback_binarized)

The only difference between the data format for reward trainer and DPO/ORPO trainer is that the reward trainer requires only `text` and `rejected_text` columns, while the DPO/ORPO trainer requires an additional `prompt` column.


## Training

### Local Training

Locally the training can be performed by using `autotrain --config config.yaml` command. The `config.yaml` file should contain the following parameters:

```yaml
task: llm-orpo
base_model: meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct
project_name: autotrain-llama3-8b-orpo
log: tensorboard
backend: local

data:
  path: argilla/distilabel-capybara-dpo-7k-binarized
  train_split: train
  valid_split: null
  chat_template: chatml
  column_mapping:
    text_column: chosen
    rejected_text_column: rejected
    prompt_text_column: prompt

params:
  block_size: 1024
  model_max_length: 8192
  max_prompt_length: 512
  epochs: 3
  batch_size: 2
  lr: 3e-5
  peft: true
  quantization: int4
  target_modules: all-linear
  padding: right
  optimizer: adamw_torch
  scheduler: linear
  gradient_accumulation: 4
  mixed_precision: fp16

hub:
  username: ${HF_USERNAME}
  token: ${HF_TOKEN}
  push_to_hub: true
```

In the above config file, we are training a model using the ORPO trainer. 
The model is trained on the `meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct` model. 
The data is `argilla/distilabel-capybara-dpo-7k-binarized` dataset. The `chat_template` parameter is set to `chatml`. 
The `column_mapping` parameter is used to map the columns in the dataset to the required columns for the ORPO trainer. 
The `params` section contains the training parameters such as `block_size`, `model_max_length`, `epochs`, `batch_size`, `lr`, `peft`, `quantization`, `target_modules`, `padding`, `optimizer`, `scheduler`, `gradient_accumulation`, and `mixed_precision`. 
The `hub` section contains the username and token for the Hugging Face account and the `push_to_hub` parameter is set to `true` to push the trained model to the Hugging Face Hub.

If you have training file locally, you can change data part to:

```yaml
data:
  path: path/to/training/file
  train_split: train # name of the training file
  valid_split: null
  chat_template: chatml
  column_mapping:
    text_column: chosen
    rejected_text_column: rejected
    prompt_text_column: prompt
```

The above assumes you have `train.csv` or `train.jsonl` in the `path/to/training/file` directory and you will be applying `chatml` template to the data.

### Training in Hugging Face Spaces

If you are training in Hugging Face Spaces, everything is the same as local training:

![llm-finetuning](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/huggingface/autotrain-advanced/main/static/llm_orpo_example.png)

In the UI, you need to make sure you select the right model, the dataset and the splits. Special care should be taken for `column_mapping`.

Once you are happy with the parameters, you can click on the `Start Training` button to start the training process.

## Parameters

# LLM Fine Tuning Parameters

[[autodoc]] trainers.clm.params.LLMTrainingParams

## Task specific parameters


The length parameters used for different trainers can be different. Some require more context than others.

- block_size: This is the maximum sequence length or length of one block of text. Setting to -1 determines block size automatically. Default is -1.
- model_max_length: Set the maximum length for the model to process in a single batch, which can affect both performance and memory usage. Default is 1024
- max_prompt_length: Specify the maximum length for prompts used in training, particularly relevant for tasks requiring initial contextual input. Used only for `orpo` and `dpo` trainer.
- max_completion_length: Completion length to use, for orpo: encoder-decoder models only. For dpo, it is the length of the completion text.

**NOTE**:
    - block size cannot be greater than model_max_length!
    - max_prompt_length cannot be greater than model_max_length!
    - max_prompt_length cannot be greater than block_size!
    - max_completion_length cannot be greater than model_max_length!
    - max_completion_length cannot be greater than block_size!

**NOTE**: Not following these constraints will result in an error / nan losses.
